TODO LIST:
1. Gather required hardware:
A supported ESC, such as the VESC, based on the Vedder ESC design
An NRF Bluetooth module (e.g., nRF51822 or nRF52832)
A microcontroller or a development board, such as Arduino or Teensy
Jumper wires and breadboard (optional)
Install necessary libraries:

2. Install VESC library for your microcontroller (Arduino or Teensy) from the respective library manager or by downloading it from GitHub: https://github.com/RollingGecko/VescUartControl
Install the NRF SDK and libraries for your NRF Bluetooth module. You can find the SDK and resources on the Nordic Semiconductor website: https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-tools/Software/nRF5-SDK
Connect the hardware:

3. Connect the TX and RX pins from the microcontroller to the corresponding RX and TX pins on the VESC.
Connect the 3.3V and GND pins from the microcontroller to the corresponding VCC and GND pins on the NRF module.
If you're using a separate microcontroller, connect the microcontroller to your computer via USB.
Configure the VESC:

4. Install the VESC Tool from https://vesc-project.com/vesc_tool
Connect the VESC to your computer using a USB cable.
Open the VESC Tool, select the appropriate COM port, and click "Connect."
Go to the "App Settings" tab, select "UART" as the app to use, and enable "PPM and UART" or "UART" as the control type.
Set the baud rate to 115200.
Click "Write App Configuration" to save your settings.
Program the microcontroller:

5. Open your microcontroller's IDE (Arduino IDE, Teensyduino, etc.).
Include the VESC library and the NRF library in your sketch.
Initialize the VESC and NRF objects and set the baud rate for the UART communication.
In the loop() function, read data from the VESC using the VESC library functions, such as getVescValues() or getVescTelemetry().
Process the data as needed and send it to the NRF module using the NRF SDK functions.
Program the NRF module:

6. Set up the NRF module as a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) peripheral.
Define a custom service and characteristics for transmitting the VESC data.
In the main loop, update the characteristics with the data received from the microcontroller.
Enable advertising so that other BLE devices can discover and connect to your NRF module.
Test and debug:

7. Upload the code to the microcontroller and the NRF module.
Power up the VESC and the microcontroller.
Use a BLE device (e.g., a smartphone or a computer) to connect to the NRF module and read the transmitted data.
